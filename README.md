# !important
I'm going to archive (close) this repository soon. Since the original maintainer abandoned 
all work on Wayfarer tools, there is no development for WayFarer Toolkit anymore.

You will find a possible alternative in my [Wayfarer Extension Scripts](https://github.com/AlterTobi/Wayfarer-Extension-Scripts).


# WayFarer Toolkit
 Enables developers to write userscripts for Wayfarer in a more convenientway.
